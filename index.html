        <h2>History</h2>
        <p>Before the days of nice looking desktops with pretty backgrounds and docks with applications on them with nicely designed icons, computers were interacted with through the command line. More specifically a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shell_(computing)" target="_blank">shell</a>.  Basically a shell is a way for a person to interact with the operating system of a computer.  A shell can be a command line interface (CLI) or a graphical user interface (GUI).  Originally shells were all CLI.  This means that the way users interacted with their computers was all text based.  There were no menus or pointers/mouse to click on anything.</p>
        <p>Today, modern operating systems still have CLI shells built into them.  MacOS has a tool called Terminal, which is a BASH shell.  BASH stands for Bourne Again Shell and is the next version of the Bourne shell, which really just means itâ€™s a command interpreter so that the commands you may type into the shell are interpreted by BASH.  BASH is also used by Linux so knowledge of BASH commands is often a prerequisite for Linux system administrators.  However there are a lot of powerful commands that every day users should also know that could increase their productivity and give them more control over their computers!</p>

        <h2>How System Administrators Use the Command Line</h2>
        <p>So what is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System_administrator" target="_blank">system administrator</a> (sysadmin for short)?  Well, in a business environment, there often will be internal and external applications.  Internal and external in this case just refer to if the application is set up for employees to use or if the application is set up for the public to use. For instance something like spotify would be an external application, but maybe a company has developed an accounting application for employees to use, this would be an internal application.  System administrators are in charge of configuring the servers that may run those applications and their upkeep.  This is a VERY simplified explanation, but that is the basic just of their jobs.  The issue is that there may be hundreds or even thousands of servers for a sysadmin to administer.  This is where the command line and shells come into play.  From their own computer a system admin can ssh into a server and control it.  SSH stands for secure shell and allows the sysadmin to remotely log into a server and have a shell into it to execute commands.  From there the sysadmin can do updates, configure servers, check logs, and troubleshoot issues to make sure their applications are running smoothly for the users.  Sysadmins can also write Bash scripts, which automate tasks for them.  Instead of inputting a bunch of commands over and over again, a sysadmin can write a script to do that job for them.  They can also use something called a cron job, which allows them to schedule scripts to run so that they do not have to login to a computer and execute the script themselves.  Overall the command line is very integral to a sysadmins job, but it can also be used by everyday users to increase their efficiency and give them sysadmin powers!
